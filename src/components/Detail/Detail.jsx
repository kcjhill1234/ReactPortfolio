        Hello, my name Kenyatta Hill. I currently reside in Utah, although I was
        born and raised in Tucson, AZ. In my previous profession, I spent over
        twenty seven years in the grocery retail industry and had an amazing
        career. Growing into management for nineteen of those twenty seven
        years. In my viewpoint, the most rewarding aspect of a management
        position was being able to be an active part of the lives of the
        associates I affected. In addition I thrived on inspiring and helping
        others to grow into their dreams.

      <p>
        My new main goal is to start a new long lasting career in IT,
        Programing, and/or Cyber Security and to get there I am currently
        enrolled at Grand Canyon University on my way to achieving a bachelorâ€™s
        degree in information Technology. I have five wonderful sons ranging in
        ages from 15 to 26. My top loves are my boys and basketball, which I
        play weekly. I am also a certified master diver with about 70 logged
        dives including those in Hawaii, Honduras, and Curacao.
